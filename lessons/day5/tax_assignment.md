# Taxonomy Assignment

Now that we have representative sequences from the denoising process (e.g. ZOTUs, ASVs, ESVs), we can assign taxonomy to them. There are several methods to do this. For a good overview, see the [**Qiime2 Overview**](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.8/tutorials/overview/#taxonomy-classification-and-taxonomic-analyses)

### Methods of Taxonomy classification

There are three basic approaches to taxonomy classification (and endless variations of each of these): Global alignment, local alignment, and Naive Bayes, or machine learning approaches in general.
