Learning objectives:

- Use the shell to navigate directories
- Perform operations on files in directories outside your working directory
- Interconvert between relative and absolute paths
- View, search within, copy, move, and rename files. Create new directories.
- Construct command pipelines with two or more stages.
- Use for loops to run the same command for several input files.

### Introducing the Shell

A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

Many bioinformatics tools can only be used through a command line interface, or have extra capabilities in the command line version that are not available in the GUI. This is true, for example, of BLAST, which offers many advanced functions only accessible to users who know how to use a shell.

- The shell makes your work less boring. In bioinformatics you often need to do the same set of tasks with a large number of files. Learning the shell will allow you to automate those repetitive tasks and leave you free to do more exciting things.
- The shell makes your work less error-prone. When humans do the same thing a hundred different times (or even ten times), they’re likely to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand times with no mistakes.
- The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your work in the command-line (rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a record of every step that you’ve carried out, which you can use to re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to communicate unambiguously what you’ve done, so that others can check your work or apply your process to new data.
- Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power and can’t realistically be run on your own machine. These tasks are best performed using remote computers or cloud computing, which can only be accessed through a shell.

In this lesson you will learn how to use the command line interface to move around in your file system.

Open up a terminal

~~~
$
~~~

The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input;
your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before
the prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.

Let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory").
At any moment, our **current working directory**
is our current default directory,
i.e.,
the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in,
unless we explicitly specify something else.
Here,
the computer's response is `/home/yourname`,
which is the top level directory within our cloud system:

~~~
$ pwd
/home/yourname
~~~


Let's look at how our file system is organized. We can see what files and subdirectories are in this directory by running `ls`,
which stands for "listing":

~~~
$ ls
R  r_data  shell_data
~~~


`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in
alphabetical order,
arranged neatly into columns. 
We'll be working within the `shell_data` subdirectory, and creating new subdirectories, throughout this workshop.  

---
### Navigating Files and Directories

The command to change locations in our file system is `cd`, followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for "change directory".

Let's say we want to navigate to the `shell_data` directory we saw above.  We can
use the following command to get there:

~~~
$ cd shell_data
~~~

Let's look at what is in this directory:

We can make the `ls` output from above, more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`,
which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

~~~
$ ls -F
sra_metadata/  untrimmed_fastq/
~~~

Anything with a "/" after it is a directory. Things with a "*" after them are programs. If
there are no decorations, it's a file.

We have a special command to tell the computer to move us back or up one directory level. 

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~

### Full vs. Relative Paths

The `cd` command takes an argument which is a directory
name. Directories can be specified using either a *relative* path or a
full *absolute* path. The directories on the computer are arranged into a
hierarchy. The full path tells you where a directory is in that
hierarchy. Navigate to the home directory, then enter the `pwd`
command.

~~~
$ cd  
$ pwd  
~~~

You will see: 

~~~
/home/yourname
~~~

This is the full name of your home directory. This tells you that you
are in a directory called `dcuser`, which sits inside a directory called
`home` which sits inside the very top directory in the hierarchy. The
very top of the hierarchy is a directory called `/` which is usually
referred to as the *root directory*. So, to summarize: `dcuser` is a
directory in `home` which is a directory in `/`. More on `root` and
`home` in the next section.

Now enter the following command:

~~~
$ cd /home/yourname/shell_data/.hidden
~~~

This jumps forward multiple levels to the `.hidden` directory. 
Now go back to the home directory. 

~~~
$ cd
~~~

You can also navigate to the `.hidden` directory using:

~~~
$ cd shell_data/.hidden
~~~

These two commands have the same effect, they both take us to the `.hidden` directory.
The first uses the absolute path, giving the full address from the home directory. The
second uses a relative path, giving only the address from the working directory. A full
path always starts with a `/`. A relative path does not.

A relative path is like getting directions from someone on the street. They tell you to
"go right at the stop sign, and then turn left on Main Street". That works great if
you're standing there together, but not so well if you're trying to tell someone how to
get there from another country. A full path is like GPS coordinates. It tells you exactly
where something is no matter where you are right now.

## Variables

A variable is a method to store information eg a list, and use it again (or several times) without having to write the list out.

~~~
$ foo=abc
$ echo foo is $foo
foo is abc

$ echo foo is ${foo}EFG
foo is abcEFG
~~~

## Writing for loops

Loops are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute commands repeatedly. 
Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing (and typing mistakes). 
Loops are helpful when performing operations on groups of sequencing files, such as unzipping or trimming multiple
files. We will use loops for these purposes in subsequent analyses, but will cover the basics of them for now.

When the shell sees the keyword `for`, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. 
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the **variable**, and 
the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we call for 
the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it. The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat the **variable**
as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

Let's write a for loop to show us the first two lines of the fastq files we downloaded earlier. You will notice the shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind us that we haven’t finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, `;`, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.

~~~
$ cd ../untrimmed_fastq/
~~~

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename}
> done
~~~

The for loop begins with the formula `for <variable> in <group to iterate over>`. In this case, the word `filename` is designated 
as the variable to be used over each iteration. In our case `SRR097977.fastq` and `SRR098026.fastq` will be substituted for `filename` 
because they fit the pattern of ending with .fastq in the directory we've specified. The next line of the for loop is `do`. The next line is 
the code that we want to execute. We are telling the loop to print the first two lines of each variable we iterate over. Finally, the
word `done` ends the loop.

After executing the loop, you should see the first two lines of both fastq files printed to the terminal. Let's create a loop that 
will save this information to a file.

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename} >> seq_info.txt
> done
~~~

When writing a loop, you will not be able to return to previous lines once you have pressed Enter. Remember that we can cancel the current command using

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>

If you notice a mistake that is going to prevent your loop for executing correctly.

Note that we are using `>>` to append the text to our `seq_info.txt` file. If we used `>`, the `seq_info.txt` file would be rewritten
every time the loop iterates, so it would only have text from the last variable used. Instead, `>>` adds to the end of the file.

## Using Basename in for loops
Basename is a function in UNIX that is helpful for removing a uniform part of a name from a list of files. In this case, we will use basename to remove the `.fastq` extension from the files that we’ve been working with. 

~~~
$ basename SRR097977.fastq .fastq
~~~

We see that this returns just the SRR accession, and no longer has the .fastq file extension on it.

~~~
SRR097977
~~~

If we try the same thing but use `.fasta` as the file extension instead, nothing happens. This is because basename only works when it exactly matches a string in the file.

~~~
$ basename SRR097977.fastq .fasta
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
SRR097977.fastq
~~~
{: .output}

Basename is really powerful when used in a for loop. It allows to access just the file prefix, which you can use to name things. Let's try this.

Inside our for loop, we create a new name variable. We call the basename function inside the parenthesis, then give our variable name from the for loop, in this case `${filename}`, and finally state that `.fastq` should be removed from the file name. It’s important to note that we’re not changing the actual files, we’re creating a new variable called name. The line > echo $name will print to the terminal the variable name each time the for loop runs. Because we are iterating over two files, we expect to see two lines of output.

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> name=$(basename ${filename} .fastq)
> echo ${name}
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

One way this is really useful is to move files. Let's rename all of our .txt files using `mv` so that they have the years on them, which will document when we created them. 

~~~
$ for filename in *.txt
> do
> name=$(basename ${filename} .txt)
> mv ${filename}  ${name}_2019.txt
> done
~~~
